- 👋 Hi, I’m @FreakADAM, not a bad Freak, but a Freak non the less. Always found myself to be different from other kids. I loved math, wasn't a big fan of recess and since the tender age of 11 I loved technical manuals and documents...
- 👀 I’m interested in video games and coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity updates advanced C/C++/C# techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any software projects.
- 📫 How to reach me, adampeif(AT)gmail
